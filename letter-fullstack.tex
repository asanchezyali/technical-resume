\opening{Dear Hiring Team:}

I am writing to express my interest in joining your team as a Full Stack Developer. With over 5 years of experience collaborating in software development teams and a solid foundation in mathematics, I combine technical skills with an analytical approach to solve complex problems alongside my colleagues.

At Monadical, I worked with cross-functional teams to develop full-stack web applications using Python and React. Our team successfully integrated AI services, where we implemented language models to enhance information retrieval and collaborated on creating scalable APIs for data-intensive applications.

My academic background as a mathematics professor at Universidad de Antioquia strengthened my ability to work effectively in academic teams and communicate complex concepts clearly. These collaborative skills have proven particularly valuable when working on machine learning projects and participating in cross-functional development teams.

As part of the development team at Morpheus, we built an open-source platform for AI image generation, where we implemented a scalable architecture for ML model integration. I also collaborated with other developers on interactive digital avatars that combine Azure Cognitive Services with OpenAI APIs, showcasing our team's ability to work with emerging technologies.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my experience in collaborative development and analytical approach could contribute to your team's goals.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\vspace{12pt}
